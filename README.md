This is an updated version of stylesrj's [More Generic Pilots](https://subsetgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=34239) mod.  

The dialogue for the new Advanced Edition pilots was broken with the mod enabled, which is now fixed. 

> Whenever you start a new game, you're given two generic pilots from the various islands. They're always the same ones. 
What this mod simply does is adds 4 (now 10!) more generic pilots; they're recolours of the old pilots but I figured that it might spruce up a game a little bit before you sell 'em for a proper pilot like say Ralph.

I've also added a new generic pilot - the corporate merc, who's unaffiliated with any existing island (much like the new pilots).

```Members of an elusive private military company with an obsession for Old Earth tech, these soldiers exhibit a strong sense of loyalty to their squad.```

Each group of pilots is also now toggleable. Includes two versions:

* Default - Adds all the new pilots including colour swaps.

* Streamlined - Adds only the new pilots and no colour swaps, for more of a vanilla feel.

I may add more later.

*credit to stylesrj for making the original mod / giving me permission to update it, and ITB discord guys for spriting help*
