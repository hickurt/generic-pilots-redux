This is an updated version of stylesrj's [More Generic Pilots](https://subsetgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=34239) mod.  

The dialogue for the new Advanced Edition pilots was broken with the mod enabled, which is now fixed. 

> Whenever you start a new game, you're given two generic pilots from the various islands. They're always the same ones. 
What this mod simply does is adds 4 (now 10!) more generic pilots; they're recolours of the old pilots but I figured that it might spruce up a game a little bit before you sell 'em for a proper pilot like say Ralph.

I've also added a new generic pilot - the corporate merc, who's unaffiliated with any existing island (much like the new pilots).

Each group of pilots is also now toggleable.  I may add more later.
